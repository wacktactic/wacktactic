# wack (aka wacktactic)

Hello, I’m wack just a coder who doesn’t do important stuff.

## About Me

I like writing code for the sake of it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.
I experiment a lot, break things often, and learn something new every time I do.

I enjoy solving problems that don’t really need solving.
If it runs, that’s good enough.
